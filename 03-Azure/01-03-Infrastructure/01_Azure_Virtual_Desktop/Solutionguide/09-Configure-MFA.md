### Task1:
Enable MFA for your user accounts and assign an Azure Active Directory P1 or P2 License. 

### Task2: 
 In this task we will create an Conditional Access policy.

- You need to be signed in as a global administrator, security administrator, or conditional access administrator
- In Azure Active Directory create a group and add your AVD users to that group
- Now browse to Security within the Azure Active Directory and then to conditional access within the Azure Portal and create a new policy
- Assign the policy to the group you created before and click *Done* 
- Under cloud apps or actions choose *include* and then select apps
- Choose the following app: Azure Virtual Desktop (App ID 9cdead84-a844-4324-93f2-b2e6bb768d07)
- Go to Conditions and then to the configure section in client apps and choose *yes* where you want to apply the policy (browser and/or mobile apps and desktop clients)
- Under Access controls select *Grant access*, *Require multi-factor authentication*, and then *Select*
- Under Access controls go to sessions and select *Sign-in frequency*, set the value to the time you want between prompts (For example, setting the value to 1 and the unit to Hours, will require multifactor authentication if a connection is launched an hour after the last one)
- Confirm your settings and turn on *enable policy* before clicking on create
